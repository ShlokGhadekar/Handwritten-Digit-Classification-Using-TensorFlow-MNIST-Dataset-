# Handwritten Digit Classification Using TensorFlow (MNIST Dataset)

This project is a **handwritten digit classifier** built using **TensorFlow and Keras**, trained on the **MNIST dataset**. It includes **TensorFlow basics, model training, evaluation, and predictions**, all implemented in **Google Colab**.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project includes:  
✅ Basics of TensorFlow (Tensors, Operations, Computational Graphs)  
✅ Loading and Preprocessing the MNIST Dataset  
✅ Building a Deep Learning Model with Keras  
✅ Training and Evaluating the Model  
✅ Making Predictions on Test Data  
✅ Saving and Loading the Trained Model  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow & Keras**  
- **NumPy & Matplotlib** (for data handling & visualization)

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShlokGhadekar/Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-Tensorflow.git
cd Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-Tensorflow
```

### 2️⃣ Open the Notebook in Google Colab  
- Upload `mnist_classification.ipynb` to **Google Colab**.  
- Run all cells to train the model.  

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies (if needed)  
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

### 4️⃣ Train the Model  
Run the notebook to train the model on the **MNIST dataset**.

### 5️⃣ Make Predictions  
Once trained, the model can recognize handwritten digits. Test it using the provided **test images**.

## 🎯 Results  
The trained model achieves an accuracy of **97.56%** on the test dataset.

## 🛠 Future Improvements  
- Implement a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for better accuracy.  
- Deploy the model as a **web app** using Flask or Streamlit.  
- Train on **custom handwritten digits**.
